# sassyCaptainsLog
Silly code I wrote for a portfolio
All it does is take numerical input and outputs a captain's log depending on the number inputted. It is highly scalable and handles non-numerical input and berates the user for incorrectly inputting values too many times. It is my first real coding project.
